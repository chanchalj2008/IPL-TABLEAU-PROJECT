# IPL-TABLEAU-PROJECT

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities and three Indian states. It was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. There have been fifteen seasons of the IPL tournament. It is one of the biggest sporting leagues in the world.

Description: 
I have used two CSV files, namely Deliveries.csv and Matches.csv to do the analysis
•	Deliveries table has 1,50,460 rows. It contains ball-by-ball data from IPL 2008 to 2017.
•	Matches table has 636 rows. It contains match-to-match data & results of matches played between IPL 2008 to 2017.
•	You can check out the CSV files in the project resources folder.

In Tableau Public, I joined these two CSV files together using INNER JOIN to select only the records that match between the two fields. ‘Match_id’ from deliveries.csv and ‘Id’ from matches.csv is used as the related field to join two tables.
